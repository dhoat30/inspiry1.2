With Claim Listings addon, business owners can literally "claim" their listings, identify themselves as the business owner and get verified.

== Description ==

Take some of the heavy lifting out of managing a new directory and let business owners do the hard work of maintaining their listings.

With this add-on, business owners can literally "claim" their listings, identify themselves as the business owner and get verified.

Once approved, business owners can add images, link to events and show an “owner-verified” badge on their listing.

With the pricing manager you can set it so the claim requires payment before being approved, payments can be taken with WP Invoicing or WooCommerce.

Claim Manager has a basic built in claim form or you can build your own claim form using the free Ninja Forms plugin.
