Allows users to create and save their own special lists of listings.

== Description ==

= Inspired by the collections section of Yelp =
With List Manager, users can create and save their own special lists of places. For example, "Must try Italian Restaurants", "Places to visit in Scotland" or "Summer Events 2020".

Create as many lists as you want, customize the list title, description, and set it to be public or private. Just like Yelp, users can browse lists set as public. Private lists remain hidden. However, they can still be shared with friends via a unique URL.

= Bookmarks, Itineraries, Collections =
GeoDirectory list manager allows users to create bookmarks, itineraries, collections, and so on. That is to say, there are so many different ways to utilize the add-on depending on your directory needs.

One of our most underrated add-ons, list manager, expands on the "favorites" concept by allowing the creation of any type of favourites list. Moreover, the concept of lists spans across all areas of a directory. As such, with our Custom Post Types add-on, multiple CPTs can be added to the one list.

The add to list button is available as a shortcode, widget, or Gutenberg block. Additionally, the output of the lists is a new page template created with either shortcodes or blocks.
